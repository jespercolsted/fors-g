## Template for a project
this is a garbage simulation project. 
a block of flats has three containers a left center and right

### My Smart City Project: [Project Name]

#### 1. The Trigger (Who/What is moving?)
Describe the **Agents** (Humans, Animals, Vehicles) and the **Surroundings** (Weather, Time).
*Example: A citizen drops a pizza box into the smart-bin.*

#### 2. The Observer (What does the city see?)
What **Sensor** picks up the information? 
*Example: An infrared sensor inside the bin detects the height of the trash.*

#### 3. The Control Center (The Logic)
How does the city "think" about this information?
*Example: If the trash height is more than 80%, send a signal to the garbage department.*

#### 4. The Response (What happens next?)
What is the **Controller** that changes the city?
*Example: A digital map in the garbage truck updates to show a "High Priority" pickup.*
