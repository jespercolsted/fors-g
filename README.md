## Template for a project
Use this section as your project build prompt.
Think about these four components and the messages they send between each other.

Before you write any code, use the coding agent in planning mode and focus on documentation first. Draft the docs that explain the feature, workflow, and configuration as part of the plan, then implement only after the docs are clear.

### My Smart City Project: [Project Name]

#### 1. The Trigger (Who/What is moving?)
Describe the **Agents** (Humans, Animals, Vehicles) and the **Surroundings** (Weather, Time).
*Example: A citizen drops a pizza box into the smart-bin.*

#### 2. The Observer (What does the city see?)
What **Sensor** picks up the information? 
*Example: An infrared sensor inside the bin detects the height of the trash.*

#### 3. The Control Center (The Logic)
How does the city "think" about this information?
*Example: If the trash height is more than 80%, send a signal to the garbage department.*

#### 4. The Response (What happens next?)
What is the **Controller** that changes the city?
*Example: A digital map in the garbage truck updates to show a "High Priority" pickup.*
